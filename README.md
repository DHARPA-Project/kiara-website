# Kiara website

For now, this repo is collecting and structuring the documentation required for [kiara](https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara).

[View existing published documentation here](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/)

See [`src/content/docs/index.md`](./index) for a proposed vague structure and entrypoint. 

Edit the content in Markdown files in `/src/content/docs` manually, or by going to `/keystatic` on the [live site](kiara-website.pages.dev/keystatic) and using the CMS.
