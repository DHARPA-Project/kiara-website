title: "Plugins"
---

If you're using Kiara directly yourself (as a module user or module writer), you can find and install plugins to add additional functionality to `kiara`.

:::note
We should probably write something here about what plugins are, how to install them, how to find them, a list of the supported ones.

Note that there might be plugins that don't have docs included here, because we didn't write/endorse them?
