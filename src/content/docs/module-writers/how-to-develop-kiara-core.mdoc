title:  How to contribute to kiara core
---

anything else they need to know? make sure you've read the architecture docs I guess
[set up a dev env](https://dharpa.org/kiara/latest/development/install/), but also [these instructions?](https://dharpa.org/kiara_plugin.develop/latest/development/core/)

This is not the same as developing on an existing plugin? eg [the network analysis one](https://dharpa.org/kiara_plugin.network_analysis/latest/development/), and this is mostly, but not entirely what [the plugin readmes say](https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara_plugin.network_analysis)
