title:  How to publish a plugin
---

I guess there's already commands in the template that help with packaging? Are there also github actions or similar?
Where should you publish to? Pypi? conda?

We do want people to publish plugins right?

Can you share a plugin with a few people without publishing publicly, eg if it has something private in it?

Do we want people to do anything else like send the docs a PR so we can list/publicise their plugin?
