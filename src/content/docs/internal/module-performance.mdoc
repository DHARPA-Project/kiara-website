title:  Modules, performance and memory usage

We currently have no specific requirements or benchmarks when it comes to the performance characteristics of modules. We should however keep performance in mind when writing modules, if the module writer knows how. 

It's hard to give concrete advice about performance, because there's a lot of variety in different domains about what we need to think about. But there's a few heuristics (not firm rules!) that might help
