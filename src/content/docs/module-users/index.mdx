Welcome to the section about using `kiara` in your own Python code or Jupyter notebook. We asssume you:

- know just enough Python to write a basic script and install a package, and are curious to learn a little more
- have a research question or problem in mind that you think `kiara` can help with

NOTE: It might be nice to collect here some examples of research done/datasets created/papers published by people using kiara, as 'social proof' that researchers can successfully use kiara to do something useful.
