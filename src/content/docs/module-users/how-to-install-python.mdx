title: How to install python
---

> We're going to need some explanation of how to get a working python environment set up. This might be in the form of a tutorial for installing python (/conda) the recommended way for their OS, making a venv and installing kiara into it etc, or might be docs of how to use a tool Markus writes to get up and running. Either way, we need to be able to give one blessed/best practice way to go from no python to running the kiara CLI

[here's some bare-bones docs for using conda](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/usage/getting_started/#setting-up-kiara). There's also a google doc somewhere relating to workshops, with slightly different instructions.
