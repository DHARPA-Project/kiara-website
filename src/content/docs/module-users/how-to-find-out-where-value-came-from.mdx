title: How to find out where a particular value came from
---

Use the data lineage features of kiara to know exactly what source data and operations led to a particular value

[here's something about it](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/usage/getting_started/#side-note-investigating-the-graph-value-lineage), [and some more](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/workshop/workshop/#recording-and-tracing-our-data)

Write something about the `kiara data explain` bit of the CLI and how to use it.

is the graph diagram of a pipeline also relevant here?

link to relevant bit of CLI docs, and to reproducible research concept section
