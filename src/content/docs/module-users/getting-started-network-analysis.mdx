title: Getting started - network analysis
---

> I think having getting started tutorials specific to a few domains is useful - show that kiara isn't only good for network analysis, the researcher can pick the closest one to their domain

[There's an existing getting started tutorial here](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/usage/getting_started/) [github](https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/kiara.documentation/blob/develop/docs/usage/getting_started)

This is nice, but it might be helpful to re-structure a little:

- pass off most of the getting started bit to [install python docs](./how-to-install-python)
- state upfront what the tutorial will achieve - take network data as csv files, create from it a network graph in a reproducible way - and restate this at the end to show what the user achieved - look you went from a couple csvs to a nice graph.
- at the end link to ways to take this further
  - make it into a pipeline
  - explore the data lineage
