title: How kiara does versioning
---

- how does versioning work for kiara core, how do I know if I can/should update
  - At the moment, while versioning is in alpha (0.x.y), assume that plugins at version 0.X will work (only) with kiara core version 0.X - ie if you are running kiara core 0.5.x, your plugins all also need to be 0.5.x
- how does versioning work for plugins? how do i check what's changed between versions, how do I know if I can/should update
- is there also versioning of data types, operations, modules? Is this independent of plugins? How do I know what version I'm using, if I can/should update, what python package I need to update to to do that

- are versions of everything visible in your data lineage?
- are/how are versions represented when you have a pipeline or workflow file?

- what does all this mean for plugin authors and how they should version their things? Are there utilities in the template for bumping a version, writing a changelog etc?
