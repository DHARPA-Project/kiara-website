title:  Docs for researchers
---

These docs should be minimally technical (although it might be nice to optionally link to more in-depth docs for the curious). They need to be focussed on tasks researchers actually do, and assume no technical knowledge beyond the ability to write and run a basic python script. (is this the correct assumption for this target audience?)

It might be nice to collect here some examples of research done/datasets created/papers published by people using kiara, as 'social proof' that researchers can successfully use kiara to do something useful.
