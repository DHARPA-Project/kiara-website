[basically this](https://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/extending_kiara/creating_modules/the_basics)

[does this help](https://dharpa.org/kiara_plugin.develop/latest/usage/)

separate page for setting up a plugin dev environment? The template readme has some info, and its quite long?

link to glossary on module vs plugin

make it clear why you'd want to make a plugin, what you'd build in this tutorial, what you've built at the end.

Link to next steps like publishing to pypi, writing docs for your plugin, including it in a pipeline?
